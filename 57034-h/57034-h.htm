<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The Whiz Bang has been selling rather fair since
Christmas, with the result that I was able to scrape
together a few hundred bucks to make first payment
on a log cabin at Pequot, Minnesota, and 80 acres of
cut-over pine land on the shore of Big Pelican Lake.
Accompanied by Gus, the hired man, and Andy (not
Gump), an oldtime timber cruiser, I journeyed to the
northland to view the future summer home of the Whiz
Bang.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the cabin, we were met by Fred
La Page, a typical French-Canadian of the old school,
and Mrs. La Page. All arrangements were gone
through and I was well pleased with the outlook excepting
for the lack of a cat. Now, it may seem strange
that an ordinary household pet like a cat should in any
way be considered, but really, friends, I was somewhat
disappointed in not finding Tabby.</p>

<p>Ever since the Persian kitten of pedigreed fame
entered into my life, I have had a natural antipathy for
the felines. La Page’s excuses for not having a cat
were apparently sound logic. “A cat is like a woman,”
he said. “She purrs when petted, and scratches and
spits venom when things go wrong. She must be contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at all times.” Which brought me back to the
lines of</p>

<div class="poetry-container sans">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A Persian kitten, perfumed and fair,</div>
<div class="verse">Strayed through the kitchen door for air,</div>
<div class="verse">When a Tom Cat, lean and lithe and strong</div>
<div class="verse">And dirty and yellow came along.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Cheer up,” said the Tom Cat, with a smile,</div>
<div class="verse">“And trust your new found friend awhile.</div>
<div class="verse">You need to escape from your back yard fence;</div>
<div class="verse">My dear, all you need is experience.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The morning after the night before</div>
<div class="verse">The “Cat Came Back” at the hour of four,</div>
<div class="verse">The look in her innocent eyes had went,</div>
<div class="verse">But the smile on her face was the smile of content.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ah! World of Sweet Romance. How delicious are
thy vicissitudes. Even the cats enjoy little escapades
into the unknown mists of the dim future.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. La Page will be busy constructing
several more log cabins from the jack pine
of Pequot so that Whiz Bang readers may solve vacation
problems this summer, and I’ll bet you’ll find
plenty of Persian kittens and wily polecats scampering
about the premises. And one of them shall be called
“Marigold,” after the Richard Garnett poem:</p>

<div class="verse">She moved through the garden in glory because</div>
<div class="verse">She had very long claws at the end of her paws.</div>

<div class="verse">A green fire glared in her vivid eye;</div>
<div class="verse">And all the Toms, though never so bold,</div>
<div class="verse">Quailed at the martial Marigold.</div>

<p class="dropcap">In our last issue we published that portion of Shakespeare’s
“King Lear” wherein Kent denounces
Oswald, the lounge lizard, which brings my memory
back to nights in 1913 when I was a police reporter
for a morning paper in Minneapolis. This was prior
to my incrustment upon the fertile pastures of Robbinsdale.</p>

<p>One evening, while “chinning” with the desk sergeant
at headquarters, a policeman brought in a typical
“divan dearie”—one of the sissy variety, but well
dressed. The sergeant gave him a private cell and was
just returning to his desk when another of the same
species walked in.</p>

<p>“I have been informed,” said the caller in a meek
voice, “that this place is a jail, and I would like to
know if you have a prisoner here by the name of Harold
Archibald Eaton.” The sergeant referred to the “blotter”
and replied affirmatively. He informed the
inquirer that Eaton was being held on a charge of
flirting.</p>

<p>Great joy was registered by the caller, and he
replied in accents sweet: “Oh, dear, what a relief! I
was afraid he might have been arrested for stealing.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Last fall I bought a pig for $5. It cost me $5 to
feed the pig this winter. This spring I sold the pig
for $10. Of course, I didn’t make any money, but I
had the use of the pig all winter.</p>

<p class="dropcap">We’ve heard the old yarn about the lazy darky
who harnessed the mule by simply standing
still and commanding “Giddap” and “Whoa,”
but the hobo that leaned against my wagon in Robbinsdale
the other day wins the hand-painted jar.</p>

<p>He had a match in his hand, leaning against the
steel tire on my wagon wheel, his pipe unlighted.</p>

<p>“What are you waiting for?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Jes’ waitin’ for you to start so the wheel will
light this match,” he replied.</p>

<p>My “storm and strife” and I were recently at a
little gathering. As I stood watching a whist game, a

obeyed with alacrity and grasped her soft white fingers,
only to have her snap at me: “Sir! I meant my cards!”
And my wife saw it all.</p>

<h3>Patrick’s Gold Piece</h3>

<p>For the sake of this story, we will say his name
was Pat. Now Pat was a good Irishman and had
attended mass at the same church for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>In the good old days, when a “slug” was 10 cents
and a “schooner” a 5-cent piece, Pat was always visiting
Casey’s saloon for a wee nip.</p>

<p>On this particular Sunday morning, Pat found himself
in church with only a 5-cent piece and a five dollar
gold piece in his pocket. During the offertory of the
mass, he made the mistake of dropping in the gold
piece. After service, following his custom of many
years, he slipped into the back door of Casey’s for his
morning’s drink.</p>

<p>“Have one with me, Mr. Casey,” said Patrick.
They both had their drink and Pat reached in his
pocket and laid the nickel on the bar.</p>

<p>“Come again,” said Casey, “you haven’t even
enough to pay for your own drink.”</p>

<p>Pat then told of his mistake of putting the gold
piece in the collection box. Casey promptly urged him
to go at once to Father Monahan, explain his error and
get back his gold piece.</p>

<p>On his way to the priest he kept repeating to himself:
“I hate to do this; oh, I hate to do this, but I
will, I need the money.” He was just about to push
the bell at Father Monahan’s home, when he hesitated
and again said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I hate to do this; in fact, I can’t do it, and I
won’t do it. I gave that money to the good Father
and to hell with it.”</p>

<h2><i>Chaplin’s New Love</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Enter now the halcyon days of romance for our
noted picture entertainer! Charles Chaplin has lived
down the shattered memory of Mildred Harris and
is now romancing with a girl of seventeen; Mary
Pickford is a victim of gossips; “Midsummer Madness”
breaks record for naughty films, and the story
of comedienne assaulted by picture director comes to
light. These newsy nuggets sum up our monthly
gossip from the inside circles of Hollywood and Universal
City.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">By RICHMOND</p>

<p class="dropcap">Lest anyone imagine that Charlie Chaplin is wearing
mourning weeds as a result of his recent and
widely advertised marital tribulations, forget it!
Charlie has been busy making much over a dainty frail
of seventeen or eighteen, who came west to work in
an Anita Loos picture. It is said that Charles finds a
delightful communion of spirit in the acquaintanceship
which has developed between himself and the pretty
girl.</p>

<p>Does Chaplin care for wild women? This is a
highly personal question. Few women apparently have
any appeal for him. Most of them seem too thick-headed
and lack the lustre of wit and conversational
powers that make headway where a high-strung, keen-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
man is concerned. It has been quite noticeable
that the object of Chaplin’s recent devotion bears none
of the eye, ear or leg marks generally supposed to feature
the extra smart ladies. This girl is modest appearing
and, what is more, modest acting. She doesn’t
smoke, nor drink; and, so far as anyone knows, doesn’t
chew nor swear. She goes about with Charlie but
indulges in none of the frivolities.</p>

<p>Not to swear is regarded as remarkable among the
movie dames. Most of them could tame a Captain Kidd
pirate and make a buccaneer hang his head in a bucket
of blushes. Young lady clerks or stenographers quite
frequently are told to leave the room when an irate
movie girl enters. It may be that Chaplin is experiencing
a state of austerity and aloofness from ordinary
mundane affairs which a man often does experience
after his soul has somewhat been seared by the white
iron of social cruelty—whatever that means.</p>

<p>Anyhow Charlie is not intending to commit suicide
as a result of the parting from Mildred. The women
flock after him if they get half a chance. He realizes
this fact, but seemingly attributes it to the lure of his
name and wealth. As a matter of fact, Chaplin at his
best would attract many women. He has a winsome
way, as they say. Truth of the matter is that this
young favorite of film fortune is quite lonesome, not
knowing who is or who isn’t his friend, either man or
woman. He is paying the stern penalty which fame
frequently exacts.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement in the studios
and bungalows recently when a rumor went forth that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Mary Pickford had been seen at the Orpheum the night
before with her former husband, Owen Moore, and one
of Owen’s brothers. Several persons swore that this
remarkable sight was witnessed. Truth probably is
that one of the Moore boys, not Owen, was in the party
or happened to be seen talking with Mary. At last
accounts Owen Moore was in a New York hospital.</p>

<p>One of the naughtiest plays seen in some time came
to light when “Midsummer Madness” appeared at a
Los Angeles picture house. It came just in the midst
of a campaign for picture censorship. This Midsummer
Madness play would better have been called a Midwinter
Nightmare or “The Passion Play.” William
De Mille produced it.</p>

<p>The picture is supposed to teach a lesson to husbands
who work too much and fail to properly Romeo
their wives. Cutting out what it is supposed to teach,
it was produced for the purpose of getting the money
by showing two young married people—not married to
one another—deciding that they would have a grand
time in a lonely cabin.</p>

<p>It chanced that just as the supreme sacrifice was
to be made, the lady looked up and saw her husband’s
picture on the wall. This broke up the meeting and
nothing much happened. Just how the lady chanced
to open her eyes cannot be explained, as one of the
local newspapers has been printing a series of articles
to the effect that when women are being kissed they
keep their eyes tightly glued.</p>

<p>The newspapers unanimously proclaimed this a
great play, teaching moral lessons. The film ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
“happily,” of course, with the wronged husband satisfied
that he hasn’t been cheated beyond a pardonable
degree.</p>

<p>Many people may have wondered what became of
a girl who several years ago was probably the most
noted of the film comediennes. She didn’t seem ever
to be the same following an episode between herself and
one of the big producers, a man nationally known.</p>

<p>The story was never published, but a penitentiary
term stared this big gun in the face had the girl died.
It seems that the producer had a well oiled case on
her, but became enraged one night when, upon visiting
her home, he discovered another man had made considerable
inroads, so far as appearances went.</p>

<p>The best dope—and the newspaper folk knew of
it—is to the effect that the famous producer dragged
the girl around by the hair and gave her such a mauling
that she was in bad physical condition for some
time. The story goes that the girl’s sister was given
a substantial bonus to make herself scarce, but
remained in town, vowing that if her sister died she
would expose the whole mess.</p>

<p>The man whom the producer caught with the girl
comedienne was married. This would have added to
the complications. Fortunately for everyone concerned,
the girl survived, though it is said her health never
has been so good. The repentant producer treated her
handsomely in a financial way, but she has never risen
high in pictures since and apparently has left the films
for good.</p>

<p><i>Reverend Morrill, the author of this article, is now
touring the West Indies and Cuba and soon will bring
home with him a message of truth. He will picture
to Whiz Bang readers the volatile life of our Latin
neighbors.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">By REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center sans">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Paris is the paradise of pleasure. Cafés and cabarets
invite on every hand. One night at Montmartre
I went to “Le Cabaret du Neant.” As I
entered, a green lantern overhead flung its deadly pallor
on me. Two waiters dressed like undertakers met me
and ushered me into a room where the walls were
draped in black, the tables were coffins, and the cups
were skulls. Like the mummies at Egyptian feasts
which reminded the revelers of death, I saw a skeleton
in the corner of the room, and the chandelier over my
head was festooned with bones. Funeral tapers served
as lights on the coffin-lid table, and to dead march
music pictures on the wall were transformed from life
into sickness, decay and fleshless bones.</p>

<p>Here death was ridiculed, but I thought this
micawberesque surrounding and setting was but an
analogy of much cabaret, roof garden and café life in
America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Late hours lure. The cup of foaming pleasure is
mixed with tears of pain. Excitement and absence of
restraint drain vitality so that carousers are unfit for
life’s practical duties of business, home, society and
religion. Midnight dissipation breaks down the reserve
of virtue and becomes a vestibule to vice through which
throng fevered bodies, stifled wits and sodden souls.
Surely they show, as the mask is removed, faces that
are anything but gay. Sin has pleasures, but they are
only “for a season.” Soon the lights fade, the sweet
turns bitter, apples of Sodom turn to dust and ashes,
and we have nothing but grief and pain for promised
joy.</p>

<p>Women rule. Cherubim of hell, they sit around in
scanty costumes that show what they are supposed
to hide, and eat and drink, talk and look and leer with
a flushed and overwrought animation of mind and body.
De Musset’s confession is ours, and first astonishment
gives way to horror and pity. The masked ball is but
the scum of libertinism; the feast is ennui trying to
live; the palace of sin is filled with yawning mouths,
fixed eyes and hooked hands.</p>

<p>If we believe with the Mohammedan that heaven
here and hereafter is pleasure, and so smile at debauchery
and defy death, we will live to shed tears hotter
than blood, dream dreams that reflect the flames of a
literal hell, and have a moral nature as hideous and
deformed as our bodies, so twisted with disease that
the undertaker must change the shape of the coffin to
fit the limbs.</p>

<h2><i>Such Is Life</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By JANE GAITES</p>

<p>I am happily married. My wife is as good as she
is beautiful. Following is a brief description of her:</p>

<p>Her hair ripples into alluring little golden ringlets
about her rosy cheeks. Her eyes are large and
brown and are fringed with exquisitely long eyelashes.
Her lips are almost perfectly formed and she has the
sweetest smile in all the world.</p>

<p>I love to fondle and amuse her. I kiss the white
neck, her lips, her hands—and I dream. Why shouldn’t
I dream—does not every happily married man live in
fancy? My dream, good God, brings to me a terrible
realization!</p>

<p>Before me is not my wife, but her sister, a girl of
eighteen years, who is said to be her living image.
Their features are almost identical.</p>

<p>The girl’s lips, however, are delicately perfect. Her
eyes, if possible, are even more expressive than those
of the other woman, and are larger. Her hair, when
opened out, tumbles like a great waterfall down her
back.</p>

<p>When with her, I am contented, absolutely so.
When away from her, I grow morose; her image haunts
me. I see her at the head of my table, by my fireside;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
then, as I try to gather her in my arms, just as I need
her most, she vanishes. When I kiss her, I know that
before me is the one woman in the world—the only
one! And she understands—perhaps. She calls me
“dear brother Jack,” but when alone with me, her lips
cry: “Jack dearest!”</p>

<p>I am ten years her senior. My love for her far
surpasses that of an ordinary brother-in-law.</p>

<p>My wife is older than I, and perhaps understands
me less than she dares realize. When our lips meet,
I try hard to convince myself that I have all in life—nothing
remains to long for. Suddenly I think I hear
a girlish voice call “Jack!” I seem to see the other
woman before me. I crush her to me and kiss her
long and passionately. Even then I am not satisfied!
I hold her closer in my arms and cry, “Mine—only
mine!” She smiles that tantalizing, adorable smile.
“I love you!” I exult! Her smile fades into a pout.
“Stop!” she cries, “how you have mussed me; now I
shall be obliged to arrange my hair again before dinner.
I suppose that ‘home-brew’ has once more been affecting
you! Jack, there is such a thing as overdoing it!”</p>

<p>It is not the little girl of my dreams, but my wife—bah!</p>

telling the neighbors that she made a man of you! You
don’t hear my wife saying that!”</p>

<h2><i>Strolling With Jane Gaites</i></h2>

</div>

<h3>He Who Hesitates</h3>

<p class="by">By JANE GAITES</p>

<p class="dropcap">The moon is responsible for many things—so is
the back seat of almost any automobile. Instead
of wading through the usual tiresome description
of the “perfect summer’s eve,” let us draw our own
conclusions of moonlight scenery and peep into the cozy
little sedan belonging to Ken Conniston, the hero.</p>

<p>As no two women in the world are identically
alike, we can give them all a “write-up” and the
heroines will be somewhat dissimilar. Anyway, just
because the two occupants of the back seat happen to
know that old Mr. Moon-Man is “Johnny on the spot,”
is no reason to claim that his rays are any too bright,
and as you can’t see the girl to advantage, I’ll tell you
about her.</p>

<p>Of course she is beautiful (every heroine must
be), but hers is an unusual sort of beauty that is made
up of large brown eyes, tawny hair and adorable red
lips.</p>

<p>Ken knows “the way of a man with a maid,” and
he is not wasting precious time by talking of the
weather.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” he whispers tenderly, as he draws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her closer to him, “wonderful little girl, I love you and
I want you to——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” she interrupts excitedly, remembering fond
Mater’s advice to waste no ammunition on lame
ducks, and realizing that Ken is far from being lame,
“you want me to——?”</p>

<p>As he hesitates, a pained look creeps into his eyes,
and just as she is congratulating herself on her “vamping”
ability, he concludes his promising little speech
with, “I want you to—damn that flea—scratch my
back.”</p>

<h3>The Smith-Crapley Wedding</h3>

<p>“What’s up?” asked the foreman of the composing
room, as he entered the sanctum for “copy,” and
noticed the editor’s swollen forehead, broken nose,
puffed red eye and tattered, dusty coat. “Did you fall
downstairs?”</p>

<p>“No,” snapped the editor, pointing to a paragraph
in the paper before him. “It’s on account of the
Smith-Crapley wedding. It ought to read:</p>

<div class="blockquote bold">

<p>“Miss Crapley’s dimpled, shining face
formed a pleasing contrast to Mr. Smith’s
strong, bold physiognomy.”</p>

<p>“But look how it was printed.” And the foreman
read:</p>

<p>“Miss Crapley’s pimpled, skinny face
formed a pleasing contrast to Mr. Smith’s
strange, bald physiognomy.”</p>

as he threw his blood-streaked handkerchief into the

such high-class service for a dime, but to assist
America in returning to “normalcy” we have decided
to fix it up without war tax and at reduced prices.
Therefore, Mr. Fallin Love, we are offering for your

<p class="dropcap">Dearest, most darling of girls, rosebud of my
heart and cream of mine eyes—My little dream
girl, how I would love to hold you in my arms
tonight and press my lips against those ruby cupid
bows of yours. I long for you every hour of the day,
and at night I yearn for you. I feel as though your
spirit is always with me and I lean on it for support
in all my undertakings.</p>

<p>Your smiling face is an inspiration to me at all
times and your voice is like the chimes of Normandy
in my ears. Your smiles are like the sunshine in Flanders
Field in spring. Dearest love, I cannot live without
you. Life would be as barren as the desolate hills
of the Arctic. Dreary were the days until I met you,
sunshine of my life and rose of Nippon. I adore you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>I fall at your shrine and worship you. There is
not a thing I would not go through to reach you.
Every time I think of your smiling face, the gates of
Paradise are lost in oblivion. There is not one, oh Rose
of the Moon, that could take your place in my heart.
The days of the cave man are over. If they were not,
it would simply be a revival of the survival of the
fittest, and I would be compelled to steal you away.
As it is, we will have to use diplomacy. Sweetheart,
will you loan me a dollar?</p>

<h3>“Piece de Resistance”</h3>

<p>A girl was walking along a road, and a young man
along another. The roads finally united, the man and
woman reaching the junction at the same time, walked
on from there together. The man was carrying a large
iron kettle on his back. In one hand he held, by the
legs, a live chicken, in the other a cane, and he was
leading a goat. Just as they were coming to a deep
ravine the girl said to the young man:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to go through that ravine with you,
it is a lonely place and you might overpower me and
kiss me by force—!”</p>

<p>“How can I possibly kiss you by force,” he asked,
“when I have this iron kettle on my back, and a cane
in one hand, and a live chicken in the other, and am
leading this goat? I might as well be tied hand and
foot!”</p>

<p>“True,” replied the girl, “but if you should stick
your cane into the ground and tie the goat to it, and
turn the kettle upside down and put the chicken under
it, then you might wickedly kiss me in spite of my
resistance!”</p>

<p>“I should never have thought of that,” he said.</p>

<p>And when he came to the ravine, he stuck his cane
into the ground and tied the goat to it, and, lowering
the kettle from his shoulders, imprisoned the fowl
under it, and kissed the girl!</p>

<h3>All in the Name</h3>

<p>A party of Louisville ladies, en route to a Canadian
summer resort, was delayed on the border by the
usual customs examination. To the question as to what
her suitcase contained, the fairest and youngest
replied:</p>

<p>“Nothing but wearing apparel.”</p>

<p>Now, tucked carefully away in one of the corners
of that suitcase the efficient official brought to light a
tiny vial (evidence of a thoughtful mother’s “safety
first” measure) filled to the neck with nothing less
than a generous swallow of the once justly famed “Kentucky
Dew.”</p>

<p>The officer frowned to conceal his amusement.
“Didn’t I understand you to say that this valise contained
only wearing apparel?” he asked.</p>

<p>The fair Kentuckian nodded an affirmative, no whit
abashed by the contradictory nature of the official’s
find. “Well, will you tell me what you call this?” persisted
the inquisitor, holding to view the diminutive
bottle, whose very contents seemed blushing for its
owner’s disregard for the truth.</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” came the reply in a soft, Southern drawl.
“In Kentucky we call that a nightcap.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A pal is in the diamond-pearl-ruby class—very
rare and very precious. But different in this
way—fine and scarce as a real pal is, intrinsic
value does not enter into his possession.</p>

<p>A pal loves, forgives, forgets, sympathizes, understands—above
all, understands. You don’t have to
explain or excuse to the one who is your pal.</p>

<p>A pal always comes to you when you need him
most, and he isn’t scared away a bit, if the whole world
deserts you. He is there to stay because, don’t you
see, he is your pal, and you want him and he wants
you. And that explains everything.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely wonderful about
one’s pal that you can’t even express or explain. A
pal doesn’t keep things back. A pal is honest, above-board,
open, and expressive. A pal can make mistakes
and they are just mistakes; but if he isn’t your pal,
then they are blunders instead, and you may resent and
be unhappy and sadly sorry—but, somehow, with a pal
you love right through everything and are the stronger
bound for the very weaknesses that sometimes hide
strong feeling unexpressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A pal is always around—in spirit and in feeling.
He doesn’t understand the fair weather quality. If it
rains, he is still your pal. If it cyclones, he is just
the same as when the sun is brightest and warmest.
A pal hovers about.</p>

<p>My pal is always around when I am most in need,
and I am inspired and spurred ahead. I shall win all
things worth while because I have a pal; and there
will be no secrets except for the utter freedom and
frankness of expression between us, back and forth,
which, in itself, becomes a double secret to the world,
but no secret at all as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>If you have a pal you have the world—and no one
can take it from you.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In this day and age of hair dyes and henna, women
who are beautiful but unwise, wise but not beautiful,
virtuous but neither wise nor beautiful, of good
discourse and good music, but neither virtuous, wise
nor beautiful, Benedict of “Much Ado About Nothing”
would be sorely put to find a wife, it occurs to me.
From this Shakespearean play we unearth the following
statement of the finical Benedict:</p>

<p>“One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise,
yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well. But
till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not
come in my grace.</p>

<p>“Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll
none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll
never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble,
or not I for an angel; of good discourse and excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

<p class="dropcap">To hear the common run of comment on the dress
of women, it might be supposed that morals grow
short with skirts. Of course, if one believes that
the human body is nasty, then the more of it covered
the better. But if one does not have such an extraordinary
view, it is hard to take seriously the arguments
of those who would lengthen skirts to preserve virtue.</p>

<p>It needs but very little looking and thinking to
reach the conviction that the best cure for curiosity
about legs is to see legs.</p>

<p>Since health and comfort are so markedly conserved
by the short skirt, one hopes never to see again
on our streets the skirt that sweeps the filth of the
sidewalk.</p>

<h3>Ten Points for the Worker</h3>

<p>Honor the chief. There must be a head to everything.</p>

<p>Have confidence in yourself and make yourself fit.</p>

<p>Harmonize your work. Let sunshine radiate and
penetrate.</p>

<p>Handle the hardest job first each day. Easy ones
are a pleasure.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of criticism—criticize yourself
often.</p>

<p>Be glad and rejoice in the other fellow’s success—study
his methods.</p>

<p>Do not be misled by dislikes. Acid ruins the finest
fabrics.</p>

<p>Be enthusiastic—it is contagious.</p>

<h3>What the Missionaries Do</h3>

<p>Says Ernest Thompson Seton, who is described as
a naturalist:</p>

<div class="blockquote sans">

<p>“Sex morality has no relation to clothing, as is proved
by the naked tribes of East Africa, who are the most moral
people in the world in their natural state, but who always
take a downward step morally when compelled by missionaries
to wear clothing. The shorter the dress of the female
and the lower the neck of her bodice, the greater her moral
influence and the greater her tendency to health.”</p>

<p><i>When the world was in babyhood, woman was the
slave for man’s satisfaction. Today man is the slave
to serve woman. William Ernest Henley’s poem,
“Or Ever the Knightly Years Were Gone,” inspired
the book from which the picture drama, “Male and
Female,” was written. Going back to biblical days,
the throwing of the beautiful woman to the lions for
her refusal to satisfy the lust of the King of Babylon,
is compared with woman’s present punishment upon
man for Babylon’s offense. This poem will be given
a leading place in Smokehouse Poetry in the May

<h3>Enough Is Too Much</h3>

<p>He sat on the edge of her desk and swung his legs.
She, being fully satisfied that the brevity of her frock
and the excellence of her silk hose would lend charm
to such a proceeding, did likewise. For she was a good
secretary, and all study the tastes of their employers.</p>

<p>“Everything all right about the Sutton case?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” she replied, “here are the papers,”
and she passed them towards him—but before he could
take them they fell to the floor.</p>

<p>“I am so awfully sorry,” she said, as he went down
on his knees to pick them up, “let me help you.”</p>

<p>Then a most extraordinary thing happened. He
kissed her. And she, being a proud girl and not wishing
to accept favors from any man, returned it. It was
a very free and easy office.</p>

<p>About an hour later he said he must go and see
Brown about the Ware case.</p>

<p>But Brown was out.</p>

<p>So he sat on the edge of Brown’s secretary’s desk

<p>She, being every bit as good a secretary as his
own, did likewise.</p>

<p>After a pleasant chat he said he must go home.</p>

<p>It had been a fairly warm evening, but about 11
p.m. it became bitterly cold and Patrolman Snorkins
decided he would chance it and go and fetch his great-coat.
So slipping away from his beat he hurried round
to his cottage and, throwing some gravel against his
wife’s bedroom window, he shouted “Chuck me out
my coat, old dear.”</p>

<p>The wife chucked out the coat and, putting it on
in the darkness, he hurried back to his beat.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bill,” he said to his policeman pal who
was waiting for him at the end of the beat. “I just
slipped round and got my coat. It’s blooming cold,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Bill, eyeing him curiously. “But,
say, <b>when the devil did you get made a sergeant</b>?”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
